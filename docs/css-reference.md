# Goal of this document

To offer a reference guide detailing the patterns, conventions, and all pertinent elements related to how we craft our CSS.

## Methodology

We utilize the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology, chosen for its clarity and adaptability. Always apply styles using classes that comply with BEM standards. Avoid using other CSS selectors, such as attributes, ids, etc.
