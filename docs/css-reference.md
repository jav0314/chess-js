# Document Purpose

To offer a reference guide detailing the patterns, conventions, and all pertinent elements related to how we craft our CSS.

## Methodology

We utilize the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology, chosen for its clarity and adaptability. Always apply styles using classes that comply with BEM standards. Avoid using other CSS selectors, such as attributes, ids, etc.

## Conventions

Rule sets we use to keep our code consistent

### Variables

They should be defined on the `vars.css` file inside the `:root` selector, ensuring consistent global access.
